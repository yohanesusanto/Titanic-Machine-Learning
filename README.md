Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster
Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster is a challenge that was made for beginner machine learning programmers. This challenge was given to predict the survival of each passengers in the Titanic based on their attributes that were already given in the test dataset. The training dataset is where users can creatively create the best machine learning models to use for the test dataset. Adding features of passengers using the information given and removing unnecesary features as a part of data cleaning is crucial in creating the best machine learning model to use.
